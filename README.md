# Task Tracker

A simple task tracking application built with React and Typescript.

You should be able to add a task with a date and time, and choose whether to set a reminder. A list of the tasks will then be displayed underneath.

### Usage:

- Double click on a task to toggle it's reminder status
- Add a new task using the add task form toggled by the button in the top right
- Delete tasks by clicking the X next to them

This project currently has no backend so tasks will be reset upon refreshing the page.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Created alongside [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8).
